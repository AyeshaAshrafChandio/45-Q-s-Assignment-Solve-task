//Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
//• Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
//• Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)
// Create a variable called alien_color
var alien_color = 'green'; // Assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
//• Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
if (alien_color === 'green') {
    console.log("Congratulations! You just earned 5 points.");
}
// Version that fails the if test (no output)
if (alien_color === 'blue') {
    console.log("Congratulations! You just earned 5 points.");
}
