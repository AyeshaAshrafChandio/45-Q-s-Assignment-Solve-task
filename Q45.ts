//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly


// function to create a car object
function createCar(manufacturer: string, model: string, ...extras: [string, any][]): object {
  const car: { [key: string]: any } = {
      manufacturer: manufacturer,
      model: model
  };

  //  information to the car object
  extras.forEach(extra => {
      const [key, value] = extra;
      car[key] = value;
  });

  return car;
}

//  the function with required information and additional name-value pairs
const myCar = createCar("Toyota", "Corolla", ["color", "blue"], ["year", 2024]);

// Print the car object
console.log(myCar);
