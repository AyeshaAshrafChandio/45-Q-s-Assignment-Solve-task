//Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
// Define an array to store mountains and rivers in Pakistan
var pakistanLocations = ["K2", "Nanga Parbat", "Himalayas", "Indus River", "Jhelum River", "Chenab River"];
// Print the array
console.log("Mountains and rivers in Pakistan:");
pakistanLocations.forEach(function (location) { return console.log(location); });
